            <div class="slideshow" style="height: 75px">
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"Creek is a very clear lecturer who has the unique ability of being able to explain his proofs effectively as he goes along. While in math classes it is somewhat the norm to not necessarily 'get' a proof when first writing it down from lecture, Creek's proofs are normally understandable in class. As well, he answers questions very well, perhaps the best I've ever observed in an instructor. Creek has been my favorite math instructor here (and I even had Fefferman!). His jokes are also precious, and he is an exceedingly kind person."</div>
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"Professor Creek is not only an outstanding teacher, he is the most thorough and well spoken professor I think I've ever had the pleasure of learning under. His examples were always helpful, and he is able to sense the class's understanding or lack thereof. In summary Professor Creek's teaching ability was absolutely excellent."</div>
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"You are the best professor ever. You are so nice and passionate. I will always remember this class and you as one of the nicest and most positive people. Thank you for making math so enjoyable."</div>
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"He is by far the best math professor I've had at this university. He took the time to explain things and break things down so that something that looked complicated turned into a simple 4 step process. He also had a good sense of humor and spoke very clearly, which was a problem I've had with other math professors."</div>
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"Above all, Creek is a fantastic human being and is one of the nicest, most caring people I have ever met. He clearly cares a lot about his students and his class being useful. Creek is a very clear lecturer, a product of what seems to be a lot of effort put into each class. He is able to make lengthy proofs manageable and provide plenty of examples/applications, which serve to show how the theorems are relevant/useful and provide useful exposure to potential exam and homework problems."</div>
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"He is a very friendly and highly approachable Professor. He is probably one of the nicest people I have met the college. He is also a phenomenal instructor, keeping the lectures interesting (and funny) and is extremely understanding. He allows students to come to his office whenever they are free and is receptive to any question one might ask. He works very hard for his students and really wants them to do well."</div>
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"Very friendly and an amazing lecturer. Very approachable, and definitely keeps one's attention in class. His office hours are awesome, he will always answer whatever question you have even if it might seem obvious."</div>
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"I knew absolutely nothing about calculus but Prof Creek took the time to explain every concept in depth and perform practice problems during class time if need be. Best math teacher I've ever had."</div>
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"Prof. Creek is a passionate instructor who puts a lot of time and energy into carefully delivering clear and well-organized lectures. His office is always open and available to students if they have questions, and he runs his own problem sessions. He is patient towards student questions, and is always willing to take a moment to reexplain concepts if he believes the class is lost. Overall, fantastic instructor, no weaknesses."</div>
              <div class="slide_mcreek">"Prof. Creek is one of the best math instructors I have had. He clearly spends significant time and effort to craft his lectures so that it is compact, organized, and understandable. Whenever there is a lengthy or difficult proof, he manages to find a way to break it down into subparts and show us how different components of the proof are just extensions of what we have already practiced with on homework assignments. He is very patient and willing to answer questions in class, and will not hesitate to repeat an explanation even if just one student is struggling. My mathematical maturity has increased significantly since taking Analysis with Prof. Creek. He also structures his course to reward hard work and preparation, and will provide directed pointers on what to focus on in order to prepare for the exam. This usually allows one to prepare for about half the exam directly, leaving the other half for more advanced extensions. Overall, he is a very good instructor while also being approachable and accessible."</div>

      <li>Dan-Andrei Geba
        <ul class="service_style_ul_level_2">
	  <li>
            <div class="slideshow" style="height: 75px">
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"Professor Geba is very good at teaching. He not only teaches the basic knowledge and methods, but also teaches how to find the right methods, and what should come to our mind when we meet a question. So his class lecture is not only the process for displaying knowledge, but also the process of inspiring us to think."</div>
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"The most dedicated professor in teaching I've witnessed in Rochester. At the same time really knowledgable, logical and has high standards."</div>
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"Professor Geba's lectures are very clear and very engaging; all of his steps are well-motivated, and it's easy to see the logical progression from step to step. He is able to cut through complexity with a clarity that can only be described as 'ice-cold'."</div>
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"Professor Geba has an amazing amount of knowledge about the information that he teaches and does a great job of passing that information to his students. It is very clear that he cares about each of his students and he makes himself very available to meet with students if they ever feel that they need extra help."</div>
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"Prof. Geba time and time again proves himself to be both a brilliant mathematician and a profound instructor. His thorough understanding of course material, approachability, and genuine enthusiasm for mathematics set him apart the rest of the professors on campus."</div>
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"This man is what every professor should be. He has a mastery of the topic combined with superb lecturing skills and genuine interest in his students."</div>
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"Extremely concise lectures, and always provides explanations when students are confused. Always willing to meet for extra help, and is a phenomenal professor in the lecture and in one-on-one sessions. Truly brilliant man!"</div>
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"He is the most effective lecturer I've ever had. His lectures are very well structured and at no point did I ever feel lost. He made sure that we knew what he was saying and why he was saying it. He made sure to emphasize important points and he would make sure we all understood them before moving on."</div>
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"Professor Geba is THE reason I took this course. It's not real analysis unless he's teaching it :)"</div>
              <div class="slide_dgeba">"Professor Geba is a very caring instructor who really wants us to understand the material and succeed in the course. He is always happy to help us during his office hours but also makes sure we understand the material during class. He is very passionate about the material which kept me engaged through every class."</div>

      <li>Alex Iosevich
        <ul class="service_style_ul_level_2">
	  <li>
            <div class="slideshow" style="height: 75px">
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"[M]ost of the math I learned while in high school came not from the school I actually attended but from Alex. He literally put me years ahead of where I would otherwise have been at the start of college, and he did it all out of the goodness of his heart, with no reward but the knowledge that he was helping to create a future mathematician"</div>
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"As a woman in math, I faced many challenges that Alex helped me navigate. I encountered people assuming I couldnâ€™t possibly be as smart, driven, or successful as my male counterparts. While some professors would be fearful to broach this sensitive subject, I am forever grateful that Alex acknowledged this and helped me face it head on. Alex witnessed the adversity that I faced, and he was not afraid to bring it up in our many conversations. From the first day of Honors Calculus, I could sense my classmates looking down on me. It seemed to me they assumed that I would never make through the course let alone excel in it. Alex sense this as well, but more importantly, he sensed that my confidence was shaken. He helped remind me of my self-worth and mathematical abilities and empowered me to be a very successful woman in mathematics."</div>
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"Alex Iosevich's enthusiasm and passion for mathematics is contagious. It is no surprise to me that he has ten current graduate students and oversees more undergraduate honors theses than anybody else in the department. I find it inspiring that Iosevich uses this influence to affect real change in the world."</div>
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"With his considerable patience, Alex brought me into the world of mathematical inquires that appeared incomprehensible at firstâ€¦ research is by no means a straight route with clear instructions, but a foggy forest instead. Alex taught me to stay calm and tackle the unknown territory with confidence and intelligence."</div>
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"Having already covered the content of the first two courses in high school (Calculus I and II), I asked Alex if it was possible to skip them and start the sequence in the second year. Without skipping a beat, Alex agreed. Unbeknownst to me, I was woefully underprepared to these two classes. I expressed my sentiment to Alex early in the semester and he vehemently encouraged me to stay the course and offered to personally fill in the gaps as needed. Throughout the year, I spent countless hours his office as he rigorously explained mathematical foundations that were introduced in the classes that I skipped. Essentially, Alex taught me a yearâ€™s worth of content in one semester."</div>
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"I am absolutely confident that Alex is a great teacher and mentor. He brings knowledge and experience but furthermore, he is an invaluable asset to the college and students because of his generosity and willingness to help."</div>
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"I had to miss a few research meetings and Professor Iosevich went above and beyond to make sure I did not fall behind the rest of the group. He was even willing to work with me in the hospital waiting room so I could catch up."</div>
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"Alex also advised some independent study projects with me, including my honors thesis as a senior. He always made time to meet with me despite his busy schedule. When I was applying to Ph.D. programs, he helped me through every step of the process. After I defended my honors thesis at the end of my senior year, in a gesture characteristic of his commitment and care for his students, he gifted me a particular famous textbook in my field from his personal library with an inscription wishing me luck in graduate school."</div>
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"But of all the many courses I took with Professor Iosevich, the one that stands out the most was the combinatorics class (Math 238) that he taught in the fall of 2016. Not content to give a flat introduction to various counting methods in mathematics, Professor Iosevich decided instead to guide us into the topic by giving an overview of recent research in one specific area. In doing this, he was able to promote mastery in the students to such an extent that a classmate and I both produced legitimate research papers as a direct result of the class. This was absolutely exceptional, as never before or since have I heard of an undergraduate class leading to that level of engagement and output."</div>
              <div class="slide_aiosevich">"I have interacted with many students who have taken a course with Alex as a part of their degree program. All of them speak highly of his courses, as he clearly carries his enthusiasm into all his efforts. He makes learning fun and relevant, bringing in research-related topics into even introductory courses so that students feel empowered and can see the big picture of why concepts matter. Every time I walk past his office, Alex is talking with students as a true mentor, and it is no wonder that students constantly go to him for support and advice. Alex is a true academic focused on teaching and mentorship, and I admire all his efforts."</div>
