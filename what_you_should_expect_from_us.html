    <p class = "service_style_heading">At Crux Mathematics, we take the time to learn about each student in order to offer an individually-tailored program that is approved by student, parents, and consultant.</p>
    <p class = "service_style_body">We begin with an interview of each student, either in person or by Zoom (or similar), in order to pre-assess the student's abilities in the relevant areas. From the results of this interview, we provide the student a customized diagnostic assessment: a two-hour exam composed of a variety of questions designed to pin down the student's strengths and weaknesses. Based upon this examination and a follow-up interview, which the parents of the student are encouraged to attend, we create a customized program of study designed to enhance the student's strengths, eliminate the student's weaknesses, and prepare the student to commence undergraduate studies with confidence and enthusiasm.</p>
