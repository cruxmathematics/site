He tutors subjects in all areas of Mathematics, at all levels. He was previously a professor of Mathematics at Assumption University in Worcester, MA, and an instructor of Mathematics at the University of Chicago. He taught courses in undergraduate mathematics at all levels -- from remedial courses at the University of Montana to upper-division courses at the University of Chicago -- and also taught undergraduate courses in computer science. He was the coach of the University of Chicago's team at the International Mathematics Competition in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria in 2015 and 2016, the latter of which came in fourth place out of seventy-two teams. He ran the Assumption University Problem Solving Group, which was a venture to tutor and train students in preparation for mathematical competitions.
