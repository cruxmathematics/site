    <p class = "service_style_heading">Crux Mathematics offers teaching, mentoring, and advising in Mathematics and related fields.</p>
    <p class = "service_style_body">The training in mathematics and related fields provided in the secondary education leaves many students unprepared or underprepared for the university experience in these fields. Additionally, the Covid19 situation has made and continues to make it difficult for many high school students to receive even this normal exposure to topics in these areas, which are crucial to their success at the university.</p>
    <p class = "service_style_body">To address the problem of un- and under-preparedness of many students for the university experience in mathematics and related fields, Crux Mathematics offers individually-tailored programs designed to allow the student to hit the ground running upon entrance into a college or a university. Additionally, our program enhances the student's chances of getting accepted at a preferred institution by providing the student with the tools and experience needed to succeed.</p>
