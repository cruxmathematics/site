    <p class="service_style_heading">Crux Mathematics offers consulting services which include teaching, mentoring, and advising in mathematics, as well as computer science, physics, and related fields.</p>
    <p class="service_style_body">We are a group of university mathematics professors based in the United States who specialize in consulting services that combine teaching, mentoring, and career advising. We will help you obtain the necessary background in mathematics and related areas to get into top American universities and succeed during your college career and beyond. In the process we will prepare you for and advise you on all aspects of the American university life.</p>
    <p class="service_style_body">Our combined experience allows us to work successfully with students, both foreign and domestic, of all ages and ranges of mathematical ability and experience. We will design a learning program that fits your individual needs, see you through this process, and leave you with the confidence and the skills that will serve you well for decades to come.</p>
    <p class="service_style_body">We are keenly aware of the fact that the global response to COVID-19 has left many students un- and under-prepared for college, especially in the hard sciences where even small background gaps can result in serious difficulties down the road. Our approach allows us to diagnose and correct these problems quickly, with an eye on the university coursework. In addition to standard courses, we prepare the interested clients for participation and success in mathematics competitions.</p>
    <p class="service_style_body">When we first meet, we will work with you to formulate a long-range blueprint for success that will take you from where you are now to where you want to be. After giving you the necessary diagnostic tests, we will work out a detailed plan with benchmarks and a flexible timeline that will quickly give you the confidence that your goals are within reach.</p>
    <p class="service_style_heading" style="text-align:center">We look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
